Audio2Art: Transforming Voice Prompts into Visual Creations using Transformers

The Audio2Art system is an AI-powered tool that transforms voice commands into stunning digital artwork. By combining speech recognition with AI-generated images, this system enables users to describe an idea verbally and see it converted into a unique visual representation.

Using Google Speech Recognition API, the system transcribes the spoken words into text. This text then serves as a prompt for Stable Diffusion, a deep-learning model that generates high-quality images based on descriptions. The entire process is fast, seamless, and user-friendly, allowing anyone to create AI-generated art using just their voice.
With applications in digital art, content creation, and accessibility, the Audio2Art system makes creativity more accessible and efficient
